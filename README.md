📊 Superstore Sales Analysis
*Project Overview*

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Superstore Sales Dataset to uncover meaningful business insights from retail transaction data. The goal is to understand what drives sales,profit and where the business is actually losing money.
This dataset is widely used, so the value of this project lies in clear structure, clean analysis, and decision-oriented insights.

*Dataset Information*
Source: Kaggle – Superstore Sales Dataset
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/superstore-sales
Records: Orders from a retail superstore

*Objectives*
i) Clean and preprocess raw sales data
ii) Analyze sales and profit trends over time
iii) Identify high- and low-performing regions and categorie
iv) Understand customer segment behavior
v) Highlight loss-making products and discount impact

*Tools & Technologies*
Python
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Analysis Performed

1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing and inconsistent values
Converted date fields to proper datetime format
Verified data types and basic integrity

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overall sales and profit distribution
Year-wise and month-wise sales trends
Category and sub-category performance
Regional and segment-wise contribution

3. Business Insights
Identified categories with high sales but low profit
Highlighted regions consistently underperforming
Observed discount levels directly impacting profitability
Found customer segments contributing most to revenue

*Key Findings*
High sales do not always mean high profit
Excessive discounting is a major cause of losses
Certain sub-categories consistently underperform and need review
A small number of regions drive the majority of profit

*Limitations*
Profit margin and conversion rate cannot be calculated due to missing cost and traffic data
Dataset represents historical data and may not reflect current market conditions

*Conclusion*
This analysis shows how a disciplined exploratory approach can convert raw retail transactions into clear, decision‑ready insights. Emphasis is placed on explaining patterns and business implications rather than producing visuals alone. With richer data, this work can be further expanded into forecasting, customer clustering, and profitability modelling.
